# Factorial Function Documentation

## Overview

This script contains a Python function `factorial(n)` that calculates and returns the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. The function uses a recursive algorithm to achieve this. 

The function is called with a specific number (in this case, 5), and the result is printed out in a formatted string that tells us the factorial of the number.

## Code Breakdown

The function `factorial(n)` begins by checking if `n` equals zero. If true, the function returns 1, since the factorial of 0 is 1. If `n` is not zero, the function calls itself, passing in `n - 1` as the argument, and multiplies `n` by the result of this function call. This recursive loop continues until `n` equals zero.

Here is an example of how the function works with an input of 5:

- factorial(5)
  - 5 * factorial(4)
    - 4 * factorial(3)
      - 3 * factorial(2)
        - 2 * factorial(1)
          - 1 * factorial(0)
            - return 1

The result is calculated as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 120. Thus, the factorial of 5 is 120.

## Error Handling and Improvements

As per the code review, the original code lacks error handling for invalid inputs. Factorial is not defined for negative numbers or non-integer inputs, and the function does not handle these. Furthermore, the recursive nature of the function can lead to a stack overflow error for large inputs. 

An improved version of the function has been proposed in the code review, which includes input validation and replaces recursion with iteration to increase the function's robustness and efficiency. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `factorial(n)` function in this script is a simple and effective solution for calculating factorials of small, positive integer values. However, for a more robust and error-resistant solution, consider implementing the improvements suggested in the code review.
